# Yet Another Software Solution

If you're using spreadsheets to keep track of things and have thought to yourself, "man, it sure would be nice to edit this on my smartphone", well Yass is here to help!

## How do we do this?

We let you execute one simple command, `yass morph app` to transform your spreadsheet to an app that you can deploy to an app store or, if you prefer a normal web browser, `yass morph www` to build an app that you can run on your favourite hosting provider.
